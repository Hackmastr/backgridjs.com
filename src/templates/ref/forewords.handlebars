          <h1>Backgrid Core</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Backgrid aims to be a highly modular and flexible library that aims
          to provide you with a set of basic building blocks for creating all
          kinds of data grids.</p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>Backgrid is primarily comprised of a set of hightly reusable <a
          href="http://backbonejs.org/#View"
          title="Backbone.View">Backbone.View</a> subclasses and a number of
          internal <a href="/ref/column.html" title="Column">models</a> and <a
          href="/ref/formatter.html" title="Formatter">helper classes</a>. In
          practical terms, this architecture ensures that if you are already
          familiar with Backbone, you can carry that knowledge over and apply to
          Backgrid directly.</p>
        <h2>Laying out Components</h2>
        <p>Backgrid's View components are, borrowing from <a
          href="http://marionettejs.com/" title="Marionette">Marionette</a>'s
          parlance, primarily <em>CollectionView</em> and <em>ItemView</em>
          components, meaning that are meant to be layed out
          sequentially. However, the Grid's root element itself can be inserted
          to any where in the DOM.
          <aside class="note">
            <h5>Note:</h5>
            <p>You can use Backgrid with or without Marionette, Backgrid does
              not depend on Marionette at all.</p>
          </aside>
        </p>
        <h2>Customization</h2>
        <p>If you are coming from a jQuery background, you'd notice that most of
          the jQuery plugins, no matter how "good" that are, for some measure of
          "goodness", are extremely difficult to customize. Most jQuery plugins
          with a modicum of complexity will give you at least dozens of
          options. The general rule of thumb is, if it doesn't work the way you
          want it, ask the author to throw more options at the problem. Failing
          that, spend an inordinate amount of time to source for another similar
          plugin. If all else failed, you have to roll your own plugin.</p>
        <p>Your laziness has backfired, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p>
        <p>The inherant problem with the jQuery plugin model is that it doesn't
          offer you any help other than giving you a namespace, and the combined
          laziness of plugin authors and users have created an ecosystem full of
          opaque plugins that produce DOM structures that are hard to
          comprehend, hard to style and behaviors impossible to alter, no matter
          how trivial they should be.</p>
        <p>
          Backgrid offers 3 levels of customization:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Options to the Grid constructor - Used for required parameters and
              generic behavior provide by Backgrid that you want to switch on or
              off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Styling via CSS - Backgrid's generated DOM structure consists
              solely of your plain old<code>&lt;table&gt;</code> HTML elements,
              just style them as such.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inheritance - Subclass a Backgrid component, give it your
              preferred behavior, give the new class to the Grid constructor and
              voila.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
