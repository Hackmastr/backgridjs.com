      <p>It is not necessary to create an extension project if you simply want
        to customize or extend some Backgrid.js classes for your own private
        use; however, if you have one or more Backgrid.js components that add
        new features that may be generalized, you may consider packaging them up
        to share with the world.</p>
      <p>A Backgrid.js extension is a directory structure that packages
        the necessary JS, CSS, tests, and document files.</p>
      <h2>
        <a id="guidelines" href="#guidelines" title="Guidelines" class="section">Guidelines</a>
      </h2>
      <p>The following is a guideline for extension development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There should be 1 .js file and 1 .css file. If your code base
          gets too large, consider breaking it into multiple extensions.</li>
        <li>There should be 1 .min.js file and 1 .min.css file produced
          for distribution.</li>
        <li>Your Gruntfile should emulate other extensions as closely as
          possible. For the most part, as long as your extension project's
          directory structure is the same, you can simply copy and paste the
          Gruntfile from other extensions and change the file names.</li>
        <li>You should use recess to lint your CSS file(s).</li>
        <li>You should follow the JS coding style defined <a
          href="https://github.com/wyuenho/backgrid/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Your .gitignore file inside the extension directory should
          ignore all output files.</li>
        <li>You should wrap your JS file in an immediately invoked anonymous
          function that lists out your dependencies in the parameter list. For
          extra credit, you can wrap the IIFE in a <a
          href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd" title="UMD">UMD</a> block.</li>
        <li>Your extension should live under the <code>Backgrid.Extension</code>
          module. Specifically, your exported objects should have a reference
          under that module namespace regardless of which packaging mechanism
          you choose.</li>
        <li>You should clearly specify your dependencies in the README
          file if your extension relies on any libraries other than
          Backgrid.js and its dependencies.</li>
        <li>When in doubt, look at the other extensions for clues in
          organizing your code.</li>
      </ul>
