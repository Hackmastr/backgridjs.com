      <h1>Extensions</h1>
      <p>It is not necessary to create an extension project if you simply
        want to customize or extend some Backgrid.js classes for your own
        private use; however, if you have one or more Backgrid.js
        components that add new features to the core, you may consider
        packaging them up to share with the world.</p>
      <p>A Backgrid.js extension is a directory structure that packages
        the necessary JS, CSS, tests, and document files.</p>
      <p>To create an extension, clone the tree into your file system and
        type:</p>
      <textarea class="code-snippet" data-mode="shell">
        $ cd backgrid
        $ make extension</textarea>
      <p>A new extension directory structure should have been created for
        you under <code>src/extensions</code>. The current implementation
        of <code>make extension</code> only creates a blank directory
        filled with a number of blank files for you. You should take a
        look at other extensions to copy what you need. e.g. Makefile,
        .gitignore.</p>
      <h2>Extension Development Guide</h2>
      <p>The following is a guideline for extension development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There should be 1 .js file and 1 .css file. If your code base
          gets too large, consider breaking it into multiple extensions.</li>
        <li>There should be 1 .min.js file and 1 .min.css file produced
          for distribution.</li>
        <li>Your Makefile should emulate other extensions as closely
          as possible. Specifically, you should have a <code>dist</code>
          rule that will take a <code>DIST_DIR</code> variable from
          top-level make invocations and copy the output files to the
          destination directory.</li>
        <li>You should use recess to lint your CSS file(s).</li>
        <li>You should follow the JS coding style defined <a
          href="https://github.com/wyuenho/backgrid/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Your .gitignore file inside the extension directory should
          ignore all output files.</li>
        <li>You should wrap your JS file in an immediately invoked
          anonymous function that lists out your dependencies in the
          parameter list.</li>
        <li>Your extension should live under
          the <code>Backgrid.Extension</code> module.</li>
        <li>You should clearly specify your dependencies in the README
          file if your extension relies on any libraries other than
          Backgrid.js and its dependencies.</li>
        <li>When in doubt, look at the other extensions for clues in
          organizing your code.</li>
      </ul>
